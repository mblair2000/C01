# C01
My first C project

This was my first C project coded on my virtual machine centOS8 operating system through Oracle VM
VirtualBox. The project consisted of inputting a string of numbers of varying sizes. A "mesa" is
defined as a string of the name numbers, and my goal was to find a mesa of length 9, (nine numbers
in a row), with a minimum height of 200, and then return the largest mesa by size if one exists.
I tested my code against multiple text files inputted from my teacher by using a linux terminal
which returned complete success.
